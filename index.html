            <h2>Travel</h2>

            <p>
                I would like travel to every state in the United States. The United States of America is a 
                country that is so vast that one visit is never enough! it truly has some great places to 
                explore. While America’s big cities often grab the limelight the nation’s state capitals are 
                also worth a closer look. Although some capitals are also their state’s main tourism hubs – 
                such as Denver, Boston and Nashville – others are smaller but no less lively or captivating. 
                Weekends away in America’s lesser-known capital cities are the next big thing. Montpelier, 
                Vermont, the smallest of all 50 state capitals, is big on arts, music, world beating 
                breweries and eating out, for example, while others like Carson City, Nevada, are popular 
                bases for outdoor activities. Head on down to Tennessee for a taste of the real America and 
                to experience the best of its musical heritage. Tennessee is all about authentic experiences. 
                Whether in the major cities of Memphis, Nashville, Knoxville, or Chattanooga, or in some of 
                America’s most inspiring small towns, like Franklin, Collierville, or Cleveland, Tennessee 
                delivers hospitality and a true American experience. Alternatively, holiday in the state of 
                Kentucky where southern hospitality is what it’s all about in the Bluegrass State. Here 
                visitors can taste bourbon, enjoy the races, and explore the great outdoors. Kentucky is 
                home to Mammoth Cave, the longest cave system in the world, as well as thousands of miles 
                of waterways. Explore Washington D.C., the nation’s capital and home to the US President and 
                Congress with many important government buildings and monuments to explore.

            <h2>States</h2>

            <p>
                A state of the United States is one of the 50 constituent entities that shares its 
                sovereignty with the federal government. Americans are citizens of both the federal republic 
                and of the state in which they reside, due to the shared sovereignty between each state and 
                the federal government.  Kentucky, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Virginia use the term 
                commonwealth rather than state in their full official names. States are the primary 
                subdivisions of the United States. The United States of America is a federal republic 
                consisting of 50 states, a federal district (Washington, D.C., the capital city of the United 
                States), five major territories, and various minor islands. Both the states and the United 
                States as a whole are each sovereign jurisdictions. The United States has control over 
                fourteen territories. Five of them (American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, 
                Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands) have a permanent, nonmilitary population, while 
                nine of them (the United States Minor Outlying Islands) do not. With the exception of Navassa 
                Island, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, which are located in the Caribbean, all 
                territories are located in the Pacific Ocean. One territory, Palmyra Atoll, is considered to 
                be incorporated, meaning the full body of the Constitution has been applied to it; the other 
                territories are unincorporated, meaning the Constitution does not fully apply to them. The 
                four other territories are organized, meaning an organic act has been enacted by Congress. 
                The largest state by population is California, with a population of 39,538,223 people, while 
                the smallest is Wyoming, with a population of 576,851 people; the federal district has a 
                larger population 689,545 than both Wyoming and Vermont. The largest state by area is Alaska, 
                encompassing 665,384 square miles, while the smallest is Rhode Island, encompassing 1,545 
                square miles. The most recent states to be admitted, Alaska and Hawaii, were admitted in 1959.

            <h2>Landmarks</h2>

            <p>
                From icons like the Statue of Liberty to vast natural wonders like the Grand Canyon, there 
                are many famous US landmarks that are must-sees! The Grand Canyon, located in the "Grand 
                Canyon State," is a geological wonder formed millions of years ago by the Colorado River. 
                The canyon is 278 miles long, 18 miles wide, and over a mile deep. It is the largest canyon 
                in the United States. Forever a symbol of hope and freedom in New York City, the Statue of 
                Liberty is one of the most famous monuments in the United States. One of the most notable 
                icons of New York City, the Empire State Building, towers over the Manhattan skyline at 1450 
                feet. Perhaps the most famous waterfall in the world, Niagara Falls lies on the border 
                between New York and Canada. It is the largest waterfall in North America and one of the most 
                famous landmarks of the US; some would also say the world! One of the most famous US 
                monuments, the Washington Monument is a 555-foot marble tower erected to honor the nation's 
                first president, George Washington. Constructed in the 1930s to supply water and 
                hydroelectric power to neighboring desert regions, the Hoover Dam was considered a modern 
                marvel of its time. Nothing more ironically represents San Francisco than the 746-foot tall, 
                orange-hued Golden Gate Bridge. This San Francisco landmark spans 1.7 miles over the Golden 
                Gate Strait connecting San Francisco to Marin County. Established in 1872 as the world's 
                first National Park, Yellowstone has been delighting visitors with its natural beauty and 
                splendor for over 150 years. Arlington National Cemetery is the final resting place for over 
                400,000 military veterans dating all the way back to the Civil War. Notable figures in 
                American history, like President John F. Kennedy and Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall, 
                are also buried there. One of the most famous National Parks in the Eastern US, Mammoth Cave 
                National Park has over 400 miles of caves. It is the longest-known cave system in the world! 
                With its height at a whopping 630 feet, the iconic St. Louis Gateway Arch is the tallest 
                monument in the US! Beyond the impressive views from the outside, the inside of this famous 
                Missouri landmark is even more interesting. A slow-moving river aptly nicknamed "The River 
                of Grass," the Florida Everglades are a unique and biodiverse landscape unlike almost 
                anywhere else in the world. One of the most famous US monuments, Mount Rushmore, features 
                intricate carvings of historical presidents George Washington, Abraham Lincoln, Thomas 
                Jefferson, and Theodore Roosevelt. An icon of Seattle, the Space Needle is 605 feet tall and
                houses an observation tower, restaurant, and bar. It was built for the 1962 World's Fair 
                and has been a point of interest in Seattle ever since. The Seattle Space Needle hosts over 
                a million visitors per year. It is one of the most famous landmarks in the United States.

            <h2>Locations</h2>

            <p>
                Located in North America, the country is bordered on the west by the Pacific Ocean and to 
                the east by the Atlantic Ocean. Along the northern border is Canada and the southern border 
                is Mexico. There are 50 states and the District of Columbia. Stretching from the northeastern 
                states down to Florida, this region borders the Atlantic Ocean. It encompasses both low-lying,
                swampy areas in the south and more elevated regions to the north. Moving westward, you 
                encounter the Appalachian Mountains, which extend from the Canadian province of Quebec to 
                northern Alabama. These mountains were among the first regions settled by Europeans during 
                the colonial period. Beyond the Appalachians lies the vast expanse of the Interior Lowlands, 
                also known as the Great Plains. This region covers much of the central United States and 
                extends into Canada. The Great Plains are characterized by prairies and fertile soil, making 
                them a hub for agriculture. Further west, the landscape rises into the majestic Rocky 
                Mountains. This region spans a significant portion of western North America and boasts some 
                of the continent’s highest peaks, including Mount Elbert. To the west of the Rockies lie the 
                Intermontane Plateaus, including the Columbia and Colorado Plateau. This area also contains 
                the Great Basin, a largely arid region characterized by deserts and salt flats. Along the 
                western edge of the continent lies the Pacific Coast Range. This includes the coastal 
                mountains along the Pacific Ocean, extending from Alaska down to California. The range 
                features several active volcanoes and renowned California coastal areas. Situated further 
                north of the Pacific Coast Range is the Alaskan Range. It spans the breadth of Alaska, a 
                massive and rugged state that was purchased from Russia in 1867. The highest point above sea 
                level in the United States, Mount Denali (formerly known as Mount McKinley), stands proudly 
                in this range at 6.2 kilometers.
